*** Saving terraform.state file to remote location ***

(1) Creating S3 bucket
(2) Creating DynamoDB Table
(3) Connecting s3 bucket to terraform service vis provider.tf



***Creating S3 bucket***
AWS region: choose same location as project (example: us-east-1)
Bucket type: General purpose
Bucket Name: should be unique (example: kalri-test-bucket)

***Locking***
s3 bucket is locked with another aws service DynamoDB

***Creating table in DynamoDB***

Name: appropriate name (example: kalari-test-table)
Partition key: LockID (it should be exactly same)

***connecting s3 bucket with DynamoDB to terraform***

Should add this backend to provider.tf 

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "kalri-test-bucket"
    key = "foreach" <-- should be your terraform resource name to recognize it 
    region = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "kalari-test-table"    
  }

  Once your backed is changed then need to run
    -> terraform init -reconfigure
